# After creation from template

This is a checklist for tasks that are currently needed after creating
a repository from this template.

Generally searching for `nx-workspace-template` across the codebase can work.

- [ ] update prefixes names in `workspace.json`
- [ ] update `nx.json` `npmScope` property
- [ ] update `project.json` `deployUrl` property for `internal-ng`
- [ ] update `base` tag in `index.html` for `internal-ng`

This list isn't complete, and may be extended in the future
