# Installing Angular ngrx

Ngrx is the state management library used for most projects.
The following command will install most of the commonly used libraries.

```bash
npm install --save @ngrx/store @ngrx/store-devtools \
  @ngrx/effects @ngrx/router-store @ngrx/entity @ngrx/component
```

In a more "experimental" setup, there is also the `@ngrx/data` package,
which should be played around with.
