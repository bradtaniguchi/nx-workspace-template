# NxWorkspaceTemplate

This is a template repository that can be used to jumpstart development on nx-workspace based projects. 
Most tooling can be used as-is, this repo only includes extra supporting files for [codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces) development, using github-actions, with example deployment pipelines for firebase, GCP App Engine and github pages.
