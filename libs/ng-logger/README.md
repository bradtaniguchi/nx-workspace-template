# ng-logger

This library provides a basic angular logger service that more or less
wraps up the `common-logger` class.

To use this library add the `NgLoggerModule.forRoot()` to your main module, with
the corresponding configuration options.

Or, if no configurations are needed, just directly inject the `NgLoggerService`.

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).
